                <p>This web application was developed by a group of CST students who aimed to solve the prevalent issue
                    of searching for vital supplies during the CoViD-19 pandemic.
                <p>Everyone deserves to have access to everyday utilities, especially at a time when people believe
                    they need to accrue emergency reserves to sustain themselves during self-quarantine.</p>
                <p>Due to the pandemic, our team has learned to work remotely and has learned so much about back-end
                    and front-end web application development. </p>

                <p>Amidst a global pandemic, shopping online has become more common than ever.</p>
                <p>However, this has not changed the fact that the fast fashion industry is a major polluter, accounting
                    for approximately 10% of global carbon emissions annually.</p>
                <p>A simple step we can all take is to shop second-hand when looking to buy clothes, reducing fibre
                    waste and carbon emissions.</p>
                <p>Our extension makes it easy for users to find second-hand clothing online, while remaining relevant
                    to today's trends.</p>
                <p>When shopping, a user simply has to open our extension and with one click they will be presented with
                    clothing options from online thrift and resale stores similar to those they are viewing from a fast
                    fashion retailer.</p>

                <p>Prescribers need up-to-date evidence-based information when prescribing.</p>
                <p>our main priority is to create a RESTful API that can be easily used by other services.</p>
                <p>This API should be able to take simple search parameters, and return a list of related information,
                    including the URLs of related TI newsletters.</p>
                <p>I created a simple web application that interacts with the API.</p>

                <p>The goal of the project is to create a mobile app on iOS and Android for NextGen Kitchen’s MealoBox
                    service.</p>
                <p>The idea behind the app is to provide an easy way to order multiple meals from different restaurants
                    at once at no extra charge to cater to family gatherings, office parties/lunches without
                    needing a caterer or having to eat from one specific place.</p>
                <p>This business model particularly caters to ‘ghost kitchens’ that are non-specific to any one
                    restaurant or brand.</p>
